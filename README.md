Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio:

P/E ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings. The P/E ratio helps investors determine whether the stock of a company is overvalued or undervalued compared to its earnings. The ratio is a measurement of what the market is willing to pay for the current operations as well as the prospective growth of the company. If a company is trading at a high P/E ratio, the market thinks highly of its growth potential and is willing to potentially overspend today based on future earnings.
